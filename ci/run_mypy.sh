#   Run 'mypy' type-checker.
#
#   This is intended for use by both CI and local development,
#   so shouldn't rely on any CI-specific details.
#
#   This is done in a separate script instead of via pre-commit because
#   running it in a non-isolated environment where all of the project's dependencies
#   are installed allows for more thorough type-checking.
