# misc-non-private-member-variables-in-classes is annoying because we have many POD classes/structs
# misc-include-cleaner wants us to use specific legate headers for classes, but we don't want to use these because they move sometimes upstream
# prefer instead to use the generate #include <legate.h>
# cppcoreguidelines-avoid-magic-numbers is annoying in scientific code - it considers 0.5 or 2.0 to be magic numbers
# misc-use-internal-linkage erronously wants us to use anonymous namespaces in .cuh headers
# hicpp-signed-bitwise has issues https://stackoverflow.com/a/58845898
